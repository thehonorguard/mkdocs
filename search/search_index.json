Although we like to joke around and have fun, a more serious and focused gameplay is asked during ops. </p> <p>We welcome everyone, from new to experienced players, with the sole exception of the minimum age being 16+. Outside ops, we like to play many other games or game-modes together (Antistasi, Mike Force, DCS, Ready or Not, Ground Branch, Insurgency...).</p> <p>Our campaigns are custom made by our mission-makers, which themes can vary from special operations to (un)conventional warfare, Star Wars, Vietnam, SCP, Cold War, Halo and more (all eras, all factions, real life based or fictional). Depending on the mission, various supports can be available (JTAC, CAS, Heli, Armor, Artillery, Sniper...).</p> <p>All new players are required to complete our Basic Combat Training, which introduce Arma/mods mechanics and how the unit operate. We do not request a full time attendance, life comes first, but a minimum per month is asked in order to give everyone the best experience possible ! We do not forbid people from having multiple units, as long as it doesn't interfere with TFO's missions.

Nowhere left to go but forward, the molten metal lance pushes forward at supersonic speed, effectively piercing the armor.</p> <p> </p> <p>(Animated Fig. 3: Ignited shaped TNT with added metal lining in Iron Shell.

A damaged hull will reduce the protection offered to everything inside of it, allowing weaker calibers/forces to penetrate the armor. Note that, in ArmA 3, the hull is still a specific armor point on the vehicle, and not the overall chassis of the vehicle.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Engine: The component generating power for propulsion and light. A damaged engine will accelerate slower and have a limited speed, a destroyed one will cease to work.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Fuel Tank: Compartment for storing fuel, which is consumed by the engine. A raptured fuel tank will slowly leak fuel over time, a destroyed one will empty itself within seconds.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Wheels: The factor driving power from the engine onto the ground, moving the vehicle forward. If they are destroyed or damaged, they will not be able to do this task efficiently, ultimately slowing down the vehicle or getting it stuck.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Gun: Means of offensive for the armored vehicle, mounted on the turret. A destroyed gun barrel will not be able to move upwards or downwards.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Turret: Rotating platform mounted on top of the vehicle, used to aim armaments. A damaged turret will, like a damaged hull, offer reduced protection. A destroyed turret will not be able to turn, and will offer even less protection.  </p> </li> </ul> <p>Whichever of these to aim for will depend on the situation of the engagement and armor configuration of the enemy vehicle (see chapter below).  </p> <p>Wherever these weak spots are positioned and how well they are armored are also dependent on the vehicle itself.

You might need to disable a layer of armor using a specific rocket type before being able to attack a critical spot. Provided below is a short overview of the different types you'll encounter within the realm of ArmA 3:  </p> <ul> <li> <p>Composite Armor is the armor that makes up the hull surface of newer tanks. Since shaped charges can even penetrate multiple centimeters of steel armor, a new type of armor was needed. While still very vulnerable if not combined with other armor types, a composite armor hull now has the chance to reduce the impact of a shaped charge. While penetration varies with thickness of applied composite armor, it can most often be penetrated with 2 successive hits on the same spot.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Slat Armor are metal cages or grids often mounted to the sides of the armored vehicle, creating a gap between the cage and the composite armor. Should a rocket hit the cage, it is detonated early, negating the effect of the shaped charge (See Chapter \"Understanding Explosion Physics\") within the rocket. Slat Armor is often destroyed after the first contact, but toughness can vary.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Reactive Armor is armor composed of high explosives sandwiched between two armor plates. On contact with a rocket, these charges launch an explosion in the opposite direction. This serves to disrupt the penetration path of the metal lining of a HEAT, effectively negating it's force. This type of Armor comes in different forms and works against different types of rockets, but the single-use ERA is the most common contender. ERAs are destroyed after first contact.  </p> </li> <li> <p>V-Hull-Armor is armor mounted below the vehicle in a V-Shape. It redirects the upward-facing explosive force of IEDs and Mines away from the passengers, increasing the chance of the personnel within to survive the attack. V-Hull-Armor is often destroyed after first contact, but toughness can vary.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Smokescreens are manually deployed by the vehicle commander by engaging a system that launches multiple smoke grenades either in front or around the armored vehicle. While they provide no ballistic protection, in ArmA 3, they disable the lock-on capabilities for fire-and-forget systems (even infrared ones), which requires direct line of sight. Smokescreens are temporary and disappear shortly after initial deployment.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Camo Nets are nets covered with leaves in the color of the surrounding area, used to hide the vehicle by blending in. They do not provide any ballistic protection whatsoever, but can provide visual cover for Reactive Armor, mitigating a fatal first strike due to misjudgment.  </p> </li> </ul> <p>These armor types can be used in parallel to offer a higher grade of defense to the vehicle &amp; crew.

The back of the vehicle is heavily armored with slat cages, which need to be penetrated with a single rocket first before exposing the composite armor below. The same goes for the turret, which as it's sides and back covered by slat armor.

An High-Explosive Rocket might be able to take all of them out if the rocket is aimed low enough.

So basically CPR is creating blood flow when the Patient's heart is unable to.  It's also important noting that checking for a hard rate while CPR is going is always going to result in at least a low heart rate due to chest compressions. Checking for a heart rate on a limb with tourniquets is useless and will result in no pulse.</p> <p>CPR by itself is not going to wake up an unconscious patient; a stable blood pressure, heart rate (between 60 and 180) and SpO2 (blood oxygen, should be above 90) is. Anyone can perform CPR and therefore as a medic you should assign someone else to do it. This will leave you free to perform other medical assistance (stabilize the wounds and restore blood pressure for example). CPR is only effective to restart the heart rate, after a patient has a heart rate (no matter how low) performing CPR is useless. If a patient has no heartrate an invisible timer will start running, and you have 5 mins to get a heart rate going, or the patient dies.</p> <p>Due to our server settings, the best way to do CPR is to push epinephrine (adrenaline), then do CPR 3 times, then check again for pulse. Epinephrine is administrable by CLS or medics only, and you shouldn't more than 3 consecutively (reset every two minutes, in case you need to administer more).</p> <p>How to determine Cardiac Arrest Start monitoring vitals using AED X-series and use \u201ccheck rhythm\u201d feature (available both in AED and AED X-series) (or attach a Pulse Oximeter to a limb WITHOUT a tourniquet):</p> <ul> <li> <p>\u201cShock advised\u201d (VFib/PVT) - administer shock. Use epinephrine and administer a shock (remember to clear out of the medical menu if you're not the one who is shocking).</p> </li> <li> <p>\u201cNo shock advised\u201d (Asystole) - do not administer shock. Use epinephrine and 3 intervals of CPR instead. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Check rhythm between steps. If you cannot determine the cardiac arrest type, treat it as asystole.</p> <p></p> <p>To treat these injuries, you have four types of bandages, tourniquets at your disposal:</p> <p>Basic: A medium-effect, medium-sealing bandage with medium delay for your every-day needs. It's the averagest of averages. Use on lower priorities.</p> <p>Packing: Identical effect to basics, high chance to reopen, but excellent delay until a wound bothers you again. Basically an in-combat \u2018fix now, medic later\u2019 solution. A rifleman's best friend.</p> <p>Elastic: Highest effect, worst chance to reopen, lowest delay. These are great to get through an emergency, but otherwise inefficient.</p> <p>QuikClot: Lowest effect, lowest chance to reopen, medium delay. Its low effect means it\u2019s great for small wounds, but needs substantial volume for large wounds; then used in calm situations with a large supply</p> <p>Tourniquets: Stops bleeding by cutting off blood flow to the limb. Becomes painful after 2 minutes. Blocks injections and vitals. Not applicable to head or torso.</p> <p>Choosing bandages</p> <p>In an ideal situation you will apply the type of bandages with the highest effectiveness per wound. But in a combat situation, time is of the essence, and that might need you to \u201cslap\u201d a bandage on there as fast as you can. Which particular bandage that should be is very debatable. Elastic bandages are quick and very effective, but they tend to reopen fast. This however is no problem for a medic, since you have the option to stitch wounds up before they reopen.</p>"},{"location":"RoleGuide/medic/#fractures","title":"Fractures","text":"<p>Limbs can be fractured.
